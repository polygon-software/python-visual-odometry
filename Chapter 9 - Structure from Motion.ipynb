Usually in SFM it is possible that the images are takes by different cameras.\n",

For translation we only know the direction but not the distance due to the scale ambiguity. To show that it is possible to overcome the scale ambiguity we now check how many knows and unknown we have. We have 4 knows for each correspondence. This is bacause we have $u$ and $v$ for both images. Therefore we have $4n$ knowns.\n",

In 2004 Philipp proposed an iterative algorithm for solving this problem. And in 2004 the first non iterative and efficient algorithm was developed by Nister based on the groebner basis decomposistion.

This is advantegeous since like this we work directly on the image coordinates. However there is a issue.

If $u$ and $v$ differ alot for and inbetween the images then some of the products can be really large and others can be small. (e.g. $u_1 = 10$, $v_1 = 100$, $u_2 = 1$, $v_2 = 100$ $\\implies$ $q_1 = 10, q_2 = 100, q_3 = 1, q_4 = 1000, q_5 = 10000, q_6 = 100, q_7 = 10, q_8 = 100, q_9 = 1$, see Figure 5).

Additionally the values for the coordinates are normalized to be between -1 and 1. From these normalized coordinates, which are better conditioned, we can now calculated the fundamental matrix and then unnormalize it to get the fundamental matrix of the original, unnormalized coordinates.\n",
